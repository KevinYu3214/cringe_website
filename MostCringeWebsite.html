<neonText>Season X is here, and the world is destabilizing, FAST. But, don't worry! That means there's a ton of new ways to play Fortnite. From the B.R.U.T.E., a new 2 player vehicle that packs some serious firepower, to mysterious rift zones, that alter your favorite POI's in unexpected ways. Huh, that's weird. Season X delivers new experiences for all players to enjoy. There's new places to explore, secrets to uncover, and the world you play today may not be the same world you play tomorrow. In addition to all-new gameplay found in Season X, there's also a brand new battle pass, that will introduce new dimensions to some of your favorite Fortnite characters in ways you've never seen before. And at tier 100, you'll unlock Ultima Knight. Plus, don't forget, there's new emotes, gliders, wraps, and more to earn as you advance through the pass. The battle pass is available right now, for just 950 V-Bucks. We'll see you, in-game.</neonText>
